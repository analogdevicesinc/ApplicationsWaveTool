# Known Limitations
## Core SDK
  - If a command expects a response, and a response is not received, the SDK will alert the user in a TX callback with alert message "Packet timed out error"
    - If a `stdout` is available, the SDK will print

      "Waiting for a packet timed out!"
  - No received data integrity checking
  - No recovery mechanism if corrupt data is received
    - The device and application should be restarted

## Python bindings
  - You must explicitly call `__disown__()` on all callback objects before passing
  them into the SDK. This prevents Python from garbage collecting the objects while they're in use by the SDK library
  - No type checking
    - If accessing data inside a stream callback, you __must__ use the data object
      names as defined in `callback.hpp`. Undefined references will cause crashes.
  - Enum scope is a bit wonky
    - Enums
